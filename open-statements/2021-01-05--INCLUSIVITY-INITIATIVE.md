# Public Internal Memo on the Inclusivity Initiative

With the advance in the [Inclusive Naming Initiative], and our recent
contributions, we are making more of an effort to align with these goals.
Software engineering should be accessible to all. Computer science, nor any
science, should not be exclusive.

We are, therefore, taking steps to make our workspace and public projects more
accessible to all (with justification as always).

These are as follows:

1. Renaming branches from `master` -> `main`.
   - No negative historical associations
   - Fewer keystrokes
     - Faster and easier to type
     - Easier for those with dyslexia
2. Writing our own guidelines for inclusive writing and code, inspired by
   those adopted by Microsoft, Google, and others (including the
   evaluation framework discussed in [our Terminology open statement]).

This list will be updated as time goes on.
