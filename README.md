# Transparency is Crucial.

At Kludge Cyber Systems, we firmly hold that as one of our core values, set out
by our owner when we were founded. We are making this repository to audit our
endeavours for the viewership of anyone who wishes to perceive or judge our
statements, actions, and works.

As such, we pledge, from the time of writing (18:30 UTC, 26/03/2021) onwards,
that we will do nothing we do not wish to take accountability for, and engage
in nothing that violates any of our core values. We will publish our scientific
findings and other related works here entirely free of charge, in terms of both
freedom ***and*** price, with no exceptions.

Let this be the declaration that marks our commitment to openness, honesty, and
absolute transparency as our core operational values. No business we engage in
shall ever be separate from these values, and anyone that tries to restrict them
neither has nor ever will have any place in our work.
